        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we replace the sinusoidal embeddings with Radial Basis Function (RBF) embeddings in the diffusion model. We will implement an RBFEmbedding class and modify the MLPDenoiser class to utilize this new embedding. The performance of the model will be evaluated based on the KL divergence, inference time, and reconstruction quality, and compared with the baseline sinusoidal embedding.",
